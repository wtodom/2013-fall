## Enhancing Educational Services Using Cloud Technology

- Brief description of the area of research
	- "education is an instrument to improve the welfare of a nation" (emphasis on Indonesia)
	- The government has tried to use ICT to improve education (list on left colums of page 2/156)

- Contribution of paper claimed by authors
	- "The purpose of this study how the design of Cloud Education to enhancing educational services availability."
	- Their cloud can (supposedly) be accessed from traditional phones.

- Brief discussion of problem/solution addressed by paper
	- problems
		- In India there are several problems with education, most of which deal with either the limited availablility of Education outside of Java (the city) or the limited depth of hagher education beyond the bachelor level. "these challenges has been made digital divide and knowledge gap in educational area."
		- Indonesia ranks low in many categories related to quality of life in addition to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) rankings.
	- solution
		- reasons:
			- Cloud computing is only utilized at a rate of about 4% in education, and the authors chose to look at it because it allows an organization to "focus on its core business".
			- Benefits of using clouds in education include:
				- lower software licensing costs and reduce technical resources (including required staff)
				- improved efficiency for data storage (student info, etc)
		- Their solution: A cloud architechture for education
			- 5 layers:
				- User Layer - Represents educational stakeholders (providers, partners, regulators, consumers)
				- Access Layer - Manages access to the Cloud Education services (types of devices and presentation models)
				- Service Layer - The details of this wasn't very well explained, but presumably it's just how it sounds.
				- Operational Layer - Handles managing all aspects of the service.
				- Infrastructure Layer - Manages/organizes ICT infrastructure facilities
			- Implementation:
				- User portal (four types of Users from above can access through this)
				- Create "applications".
				- Multimedia Information Retrieval System - didn't quite understand this one. Maybe a basic search engine?
				- Collect data on multimedia.
				- They "develop web services to communicate with outside world until all of services offered can be integration with existing services and also to maintain portal interoperability."
				- Multi-access channel enables access from various devices.
			- Testing:
				- First they simulated some use cases (or something?) on a private
				cloud (not the one they are supposedly developing).
				- Test for availability - They could access their stuff on tablets, smart phones, traditional computers, and traditional phones. Other clouds don't work with traditional phones.
				- Apparently they verified that their cloud can interact with outside services somehow.
				- There were a couple others, but they seemed even less like tests than the first one.



- Criticism of the paper and how you would improve it
	- It speaks very generally about how Cloud will be used and how the costs will be reduced on page 3/157 on the left.
	- They were very vague about the Service Layer.
	- They gave almost no details about these supposed "applications".
	- Multi-access channel gives 0 details.
	- No details on tests. Just more claims that barely make sense.
	- It looks like the only benefit they actually created was that their service could be used on traditional phones. Maybe they should have focused research on spreading internet access instead?

- What you liked about the paper
	-

- You should also list 2 questions that you will ask the class during the discussion

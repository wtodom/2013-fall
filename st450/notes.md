ST450 - Statistics
==================

## 27 August 2013

- Example of an observational study
	- At some bank, there are 32 male clerks and 61 female clerks.
	- Goal is to compare their starting salaries.
	- Results: (see notebook-2)
	- We have convincing evidence that the males received larger starting salaries than the females. Did the bank discriminatorily pay higher starting salaries to men than women?
		- No. It is only an observational study, so we can't know enough about the participants. The evidence is consistent with discrimination, but there are other possible explanations (e.g. difference in years of prior experience, position, degree, etc.)
- IMPORTANT: We cannot draw cause and effect conclusions from observational studies.
- Why do we need observational studies?
	1. Sometimes randomized experiments are not possible. (se above example)
	2. Randomized studies aren't possible for ethical or other reasons (e.g. can't force people to do drugs.)
	3. They suggest areas/topics for future studies, perhaps randomized experiments.

contents of table, notebook-3:
<table style="border: 1px solid black">
	<tr >
		<td style="border: 1px solid black">A random sample is selected from one population; units are randomly assigned to different treatment groups.</td>
		<td style="border: 1px solid black">Random samples are selected from existing distinct populations</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="border: 1px solid black">A groups of study units is found; units are then randomly assigned to treatment groups.</td>
		<td style="border: 1px solid black">Collection of available units from distinct groups are examined.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

prior to this will not be tested, but will have homework

##### Graphical Representations

- dotplot
- stem-and-leaf diagram
- histogram
- boxplaot (covered a little later)
- scatterplot (also covered a little later)

!! notebook-4 !!

##### Measures of Central Tendency

- Mean
	- sum of measurements divided by the number of measurements.
	- distinguish between population mean and sample mean
		- notebook-5
- Median
	- middle element in the ordered sample if n is odd, else the middle of the middle two elements.
- Mode
	- the measurement that occurs most frequently.

##### Measures of Variability

- measure spread in data
	- Range
		- notebook-6
	- Variance

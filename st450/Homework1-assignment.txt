1. Randomized experiment or observational study?
A study was carried out to determine the effect of receiving free milk on the achievement of children at school. The idea is that many children don’t have adequate breakfast, so it would help to give free milk. This part of the study was carried at one school. Seven year old children were randomly assigned by investigators into a milk group and a control group (no milk). After randomization, the assignments of some children were switched by their teachers to insure that children from poor families got milk. At the end of the year, every child took a test of reading ability. The statistical analysis compared average reading scores for the two groups.
